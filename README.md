# Microfiche

Microfiche is a simple Swift library for archiving your model objects.

## How To

Microfiche takes your Swift Collection, `Array<T>`, `Set<T>`, `Dictionary<T,U>`
and converts them to a form which is "NSCoding" compliant. 

On the other end Microfiche takes your "NSCoding compliant blob of data and
converts it back to your preferred Swift Collection type.

## Frameworks

Microfiche is a Dynamic Framework, meaning that you can check it out and build
it yourself, or add it to your Cartfile or just add it as a subproject in your
workspace.
